    "R-squared (coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness-of-fit of a linear regression model. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, R-squared is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(SS_{res}\\) is the sum of squares of residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values).\n",
    "- \\(SS_{tot}\\) is the total sum of squares, which measures the total variance of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n",
    "- 0 indicates that the independent variables do not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
    "- 1 indicates that the independent variables explain all of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of R-squared:\n",
    "- A higher R-squared value indicates that a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables in the model, suggesting a better fit.\n",
    "- A lower R-squared value indicates that the model does not explain much of the variance in the dependent variable and may not be useful for prediction or inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that R-squared alone does not indicate whether a regression model is good or bad. It should be interpreted in conjunction with other factors such as the context of the data, the assumptions of the model, and the practical significance of the relationships between variables. Additionally, R-squared can be misleading when used with complex models or when overfitting occurs."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the regular R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors (independent variables) in the model. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary predictors that do not significantly improve the model's explanatory power.\n",

    "Adjusted R-squared differs from the regular R-squared in that it accounts for the number of predictors in the model, adjusting the value to penalize the inclusion of unnecessary predictors. As a result, adjusted R-squared tends to be lower than regular R-squared when additional predictors are added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of adjusted R-squared is similar to regular R-squared. A higher adjusted R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, considering the number of predictors in the model.

Adjusted R-squared is often used in conjunction with regular R-squared to assess the overall goodness-of-fit of a regression model."

    "\n",
    "1. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):\n",
    "   - Advantages:\n",
    "     - RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors, making it more sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "     - It provides a measure of the typical size of errors, with values directly interpretable in the same units as the dependent variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. MSE (Mean Squared Error):\n",
    "   - Advantages:\n",
    "     - MSE is a mathematical convenience, particularly in optimization algorithms, as it's differentiable and easily minimized.\n",
    "     - It provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors, which can be useful for comparing models.\n",
    "   - Disadvantages:\n",
    "     - Similar to RMSE, MSE can heavily penalize large errors and be sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "     - Like RMSE, it may not be suitable for skewed or non-normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error):\n",
    "   - Advantages:\n",
    "     - MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE and MSE, as it does not square the errors.\n",
    "     - It provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors, similar to MSE, but without the issue of heavily penalizing large errors.\n",
    "   - Disadvantages:\n",
    "     - MAE treats all errors equally regardless of their size, which may not always be desirable, especially if larger errors should be penalized more heavily.\n",
    "     - It may not be as mathematically convenient as RMSE and MSE for optimization purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. RMSE is commonly used when larger errors should be penalized more heavily, while MAE is preferred when all errors should be treated equally.
